                "The correct answer is A. 48% chose this. Salmeterol and albuterol act selectively at ß2-adrenergic receptors, causing bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. Catecholamines in general promote potassium entry into cells by increasing the activities of the Na-K-ATPase pump, and the Na-K-2Cl (NKCC1) cotransporter. These ß-agonists have been proven in randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses to improve symptoms and lung function. They are typically prescribed on an as-needed basis rather than regularly scheduled, to decrease exposure in patients with less severe symptoms. Risks of ß-agonist overuse include tremor, tachycardia, and hypokalemia. As this patient is likely presenting with overdose of his albuterol inhaler, it is possible that he has developed hypokalemia, which can be very dangerous. The easiest way to measure serum potassium is through a basic metabolic panel, which quantiﬁes serum sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, creatinine, BUN, and glucose.",

Nonetheless, this patient is not presenting with any symptoms of infection or pneumonia. Although chest X-rays are useful in monitoring the status of chronic lung conditions such as COPD, it is highly unlikely that this patient's COPD has changed signiﬁcantly since his ofﬁce visit 1 week ago.",

It is far more likely that he is overusing his newly prescribed ß-agonist.",

Sulfonylureas act by increasing pancreatic production of insulin by β islet cells. Although vomiting can occur with alcohol toxicity, this patient is oriented and appropriate without ataxia, making this unlikely. Instead, this patient is presenting with signs of a disulfiram-like reaction after alcohol consumption, which include nausea, vomiting, headache, flushing, and tachycardia. First-generation sulfonylureas, and chlorpropamide in particular, can cause a disulfiram-like reaction when taken with ethanol. Other medications that are known to cause disulfiram-like reactions include metronidazole, procarbazine, and some cephalosporins.",

Acarbose is an α-glucosidase inhibitor that blocks the enzyme responsible for sugar hydrolysis at the intestinal lumen border, mitigating the spike in blood glucose after a meal. The adverse effects of α-glucosidase inhibitors are gastrointestinal disturbances causing abdominal pain and diarrhea.",
                "C is not correct. 7% chose this. Glargine is a long-acting synthetic insulin that provides a continuous baseline level of insulin in the blood. The most important adverse effect associated with this agent is hypoglycemia if this drug is taken in excess. Although hypoglycemia can lead to tachycardia, the physician also expects confusion or altered mental status and shakiness, which this patient does not have.",

The most important adverse effect associated with this agent is hypoglycemia. Second-generation sulfonylureas are much less likely to cause a disulfiram-like reaction than their first-generation kin. Because sulfonylureas are metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys, liver or renal insufficiency is a contraindication to their use.",

                "The correct answer is B. 82% chose this. People with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes are highly susceptible to developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Based on his basic metabolic panel, the patient has a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia (>300 mg/dL), low bicarbonate levels (<15 mEq/L), acidosis (pH < 7.30), ketonemia, ketonuria, and dehydration. The absolute absence of insulin prevents cells from utilizing glucose. Fat becomes an alternative energy source, and in the process of fat breakdown, ketones are formed. The excess ketones cause an anion-gap metabolic acidosis, and patients with DKA compensate by hyperventilating. The severe dehydration and persistent acidemia have detrimental neurologic effects. Therefore it is common for patients with DKA to have changes in mental status, as well as nausea and vomiting. An infection often may precipitate DKA, so if a diabetic patient presents after a few days of pains or fevers, it is possible that besides the primary complaint, the patient subsequently may have developed DKA.",

DIC can be caused by obstetric complications, gram-negative sepsis, acute promyelocytic leukemia, and burns, but not by diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient has no signs suggestive of DIC.",

When taken in large doses, acetaminophen causes hepatic necrosis, resulting in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, and liver failure. Treatment is early administration of N-acetylcysteine. The patient has no history of acetaminophen intake.",

After primary stabilization (propranolol and attention to airway, breathing, and circulation), methimazole is the most appropriate pharmacologic treatment for this condition. Propylthiouracil is an alternative treatment that may be administered to patients who cannot tolerate methimazole or pregnant patients for whom methimazole is contraindicated due to its teratogenicity.

A leak into the dorsal (shown in the image) and saphenous (not shown in the image) veins, whichdemonstrates a venous outﬂow abnormality, is typically due to insufﬁcient relaxation of the smooth muscle resulting from excessive adrenergic tone or damaged parasympathetic innervation. In a normal erection, blood ﬂow accelerates, increasing the pressure within the intracavernous spaces and blocking penile venous outﬂow. Abnormalities in venous outﬂow, such as the leak from the dorsal vein to the external pudendal veins, a tributary of the great saphenous vein, in this patient can result in failure to acquire or maintain a ﬁrm erection.",

                "The correct answer is C. 58% chose this. Given the patient's body habitus and glucose level, a diagnosis of diabetes is extremely likely. The patient is presenting after recent surgery with symptoms consistent with lactic acidosis. His low bicarbonate is concerning for an acidotic state. Calculating the anion gap [Na - (Cl + HCO3-) = anion gap] gives a result of 18. The physiologic range of the anion gap in healthy adults is 8-12 mEq/L. High-anion-gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by multiple conditions and can be remembered by the mnemonic MUDPILES: Methanol, Uremia, Diabetic ketoacidosis, Paraldehyde, Infection or isoniazid, Lactic acidosis, Ethylene glycol, and Salicylates. Metformin is a biguanide that suppresses hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity. It is known to increase the risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in those with renal impairment (the patient in this case has an elevated creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL), as well as in the postoperative period if it is stopped for an extended period.",
                "A is not correct. 13% chose this. Glyburide is a sulfonylurea that increases pancreatic secretion of insulin by depolarizing the β-cell membranes. Its major adverse effect is hypoglycemia, which could present as loss of consciousness, seizure, or altered mental status. However, the patient's lab values show that he is actually hyperglycemic, making glyburide less likely.",
                "B is not correct. 8% chose this. Insulin as a pharmacologic preparation is not administered orally, but rather is subcutaneously injected. It binds the insulin receptor to increase hepatic glycogen production from glucose and promote protein synthesis in muscle. A major adverse effect of insulin treatment is hypoglycemia, weight gain, and injection-site lipodystrophy, but it is not associated with lactic acidosis.",
                "D is not correct. 10% chose this. Orlistat alters fat metabolism by decreasing pancreatic lipase activity. It is often used for long-term weight management, and causes gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as loose and fatty stools (steatorrhea), diminished absorption of vitamins A, D, K, and E, and headache. It has not been associated with lactic acidosis.",
                "E is not correct. 11% chose this. Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that increases tissue sensitivity/target cell response to insulin. A major adverse effect of this medication is weight gain and edema, and it has also recently been associated with increased cardiovascular risks. However, it is not known to cause lactic acidosis."

One of the most important concerns in a young woman of reproductive age who presents with acute, severe abdominal pain is ectopic pregnancy. The physical examination ﬁndings of abdominal pain with tenderness and rebound suggest peritoneal irritation, in this case most likely from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This process could also produce signiﬁcant bleeding into the peritoneal cavity, leading to hypotension. A pregnancy test, which detects the hormone β-human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG), either in the urine or in the plasma 8 days after successful fertilization, will be positive. β-hCG is a glycoprotein produced by the fertilized dividing egg during the ﬁrst trimester, and later by the placenta. This hormone's main function is to maintain the corpus luteum, the main source of progesterone, which is critical in maintaining the pregnancy. It also tends to be trended upward throughout initial days of pregnancy. βhCG has a distinctive α subunit, which it shares with other glycoprotein hormones, including thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. All of the glycoproteins with the exception of β-hCG are produced in the anterior pituitary gland.",

Volume depletion and increased plasma osmolality stimulate its secretion. It promotes the insertion of aquaporin channels into the renal collecting ducts, thus augmenting free water reabsorption.",
                "C is not correct. 7% chose this. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) is another product of the precursor proopiomelanocortin.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma usually can be cured by resection of the primary tumor. Diagnosis is often made by fine-needle biopsy. The histologic finding in the image is a psammoma body (a concentrically laminated, calcified structure), which is found in approximately 50% of papillary adenocarcinomas of the thyroid. Psammoma bodies are also found in serous papillary cystadenocarcinomas of the ovary, meningiomas, and malignant mesotheliomas.",

Unlike papillary carcinoma, in which hematogenous metastasis is rare, follicular carcinomas commonly metastasize via the blood to lungs or bones. Histologically, follicular carcinomas tend to form acini or follicles lined with cells that are larger than those found in normal thyroid. Psammoma bodies are not found in follicular carcinoma.",

                "The correct answer is A. 67% chose this. This individual is having a myocardial infarction (likely anterolateral given V3-V6 distribution), as suggested by his symptoms and ST-segment elevation on ECG. Sudden cardiac death in the setting of an MI is most commonly caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias, in particular ventricular fibrillation (VF). These arrhythmias are thought to be a result of the damaged, ischemic myocardium producing a substrate that is capable of abnormal reentry circuits. This results in the loss of coordinated contraction of the heart and perfusion of vital organs. VF is almost universally lethal if not treated; it very rarely reverts spontaneously to sinus rhythm. Immediate defibrillation is indicated, followed by medical treatment with intravenous amiodarone.",
                "B is not correct. 16% chose this. Cardiogenic shock carries a high risk of mortality and is associated with a large infarct. Any type of shock results in inadequate organ perfusion. Patients with cardiogenic shock present with hypotension and tachycardia.",
                "C is not correct. 5% chose this. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a later sequela of an MI that affects a large area of myocardial tissue. It results from functional myocardium being replaced with nonfunctional scar tissue, decreasing the heart's ability to contract, and leading to decreased ejection fraction. CHF would not present this soon after an MI.",
                "D is not correct. 3% chose this. Fibrinous pericarditis is associated with transmural infarctions and typically occurs 3-5 days post-MI. Some degree of diastolic dysfunction may occur due to inability of the ventricle to fully relax due to the transudate that collects in the pericardial sac. Physical examination typically reveals a friction rub.

Hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis are symptoms of primary aldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), which is due to increased aldosterone secretion by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenals. As a consequence of the increased aldosterone activity in the principal cells of the collecting duct, an increase in sodium reuptake is accompanied by a concurrent increase in potassium excretion. Also, water is passively reabsorbed along with sodium, resulting in hypervolemia and higher blood pressures.

Warfarin is an anticoagulant that inhibits the synthesis and γ-carboxylation of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. It is metabolized by the CYP450 system, primarily the CYP2C9 member. Note that the prothrombin time (PT), not the partial thromboplastin time, is used to follow warfarin levels. In this scenario, the INR is 1.05 which is subtherapeutic. This suggests inadequate anticoagulation possibly due to increased warfarin metabolism.",

Oliguric renal failure can be caused by a number of different conditions, and the specific findings on examination of the kidneys at autopsy would depend on the underlying cause. In general, however, the kidneys may show signs of damage or scarring if the individual had chronic kidney disease or if they experienced a severe episode of acute kidney injury. In some cases, the kidneys may appear normal if the individual's oliguria resolved and their renal function returned to normal before their death.

Opioids are a class of medications that are commonly used to manage pain, and they work by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and other tissues. However, opioids can also have adverse effects, including respiratory depression, which is a condition in which the body's ability to breathe is impaired. In a pregnant woman who is receiving an intravenous opioid, this could potentially lead to neonatal respiratory depression in the baby. This is particularly concerning in the context of labor and delivery, when the baby is already at risk of respiratory distress due to the physical stresses of being born.

This is because when the body is in a supine position, gravity no longer has as strong of an effect on blood flow, allowing blood to pool in the veins and leading to a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. The Carotid Sinus Baroreceptor and Vagal Efferent Activity to the Heart are both part of the body's reflexive mechanism for regulating blood pressure, so their activity would decrease in response to the decreased blood pressure. Meanwhile, the Atrial Stretch Receptor Activity would increase due to the increased volume of blood in the veins, leading to increased stretch in the atrial walls and stimulating the receptors. The answer is therefore (F) Carotid Sinus Baroreceptor Activity and Vagal Efferent Activity to the Heart decrease, while Atrial Stretch Receptor Activity increase.",

The high hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, as well as the increased platelet count and the presence of occasional giant platelets on the peripheral blood smear, suggest that the patient may have a condition known as essential thrombocythemia. This is a type of blood cancer in which the bone marrow produces too many platelets, leading to an increased risk of blood clots. The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase levels and the presence of splenomegaly on physical examination also support this diagnosis.

He has no symptoms or history of major medical illness. The patient’s maternal grandfather died of Huntington disease at the age of 35 years. Genetic testing of the mother showed 19 triplet repeats on each huntingtin (HTT) allele (N=10–20). The patient’s paternal grandfather had colon cancer at the age of 30 years, and the father had numerous colon polyps at the age of 20 years treated with a colectomy.

As mentioned in the previous answers, the patient's family history puts them at an increased risk for Huntington disease, which is caused by a mutation in the HTT gene that results in an expanded number of CAG trinucleotide repeats. The severity of the disease is directly related to the number of repeats, and the patient's mother has 19 triplet repeats on each HTT allele, which puts the patient at an increased risk for Huntington disease. Genetic testing can determine the number of repeats in the patient's HTT gene and help guide appropriate medical management.

Myasthenia gravis is a autoimmune disorder that affects the ability of the muscles to respond to nerve impulses, causing weakness and rapid fatigue. In severe cases, the weakness can affect the muscles involved in breathing, putting the patient at risk of respiratory compromise. In this case, the patient's symptoms suggest that she is at risk of respiratory failure and should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. However, the patient has expressed her reluctance to undergo further testing and treatment, and it is important to determine whether she has the capacity to make decisions about her own care. If she does not have the capacity to make decisions about her own care, involuntary hospital admission may be necessary to protect her from harm.",

She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, \"I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months.\" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her \"drop attacks?\"",

It's important to stay vigilant and proactive in monitoring your health, and I encourage you to discuss these recommendations with your primary care physician for further guidance.",
