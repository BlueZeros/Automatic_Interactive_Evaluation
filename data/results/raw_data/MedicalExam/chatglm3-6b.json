Students should note, however, that these are oversimpliﬁcations. All the systemic mycoses can cause infection in a number of sites. Althoughmeningoencephalitis is the most common clinical manifestation of cryptococcal disease, it is not the only one. In fact, the initial site of inoculation with Cryptococcus is the lung; meningitis can ensue only after theyeasts have disseminated from this site. Patients present more often with cryptococcal meningitis, in large part because many lung infections are asymptomatic. When an individual does experience symptoms from cryptococcal pneumonia (the second most common clinical manifestation), the symptoms can include fever, fatigue, cough, and pleuritic chest pain.

Catecholamines in general promote potassium entry into cells by increasing the activities of the Na-K-ATPase pump, and the Na-K-2Cl (NKCC1) cotransporter. These ß-agonists have been proven in randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses to improve symptoms and lung function. They are typically prescribed on an as-needed basis rather than regularly scheduled, to decrease exposure in patients with less severe symptoms. Risks of ß-agonist overuse include tremor, tachycardia, and hypokalemia. As this patient is likely presenting with overdose of his albuterol inhaler, it is possible that he has developed hypokalemia, which can be very dangerous. The easiest way to measure serum potassium is through a basic metabolic panel, which quantiﬁes serum sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, creatinine, BUN, and glucose.",

It works by forming an irreversible bond with aromatase. Two nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors are anastrozole and letrozole, which inhibit aromatase via reversible competition. It is used to treat postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer. It is often used after 2–3 years of tamoxifen treatment, or in patients who have hormone-responsive breast cancer that advances despite tamoxifen treatment. Unlike premenopausal women, for whom estrogen is predominantly synthesized in the ovary, estrogen in postmenopausal women is largely derived from the adrenal gland, where aromatase converts androgens to estrogen.",

Finasteride, an inhibitor of this enzyme, is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, and male pattern baldness.

Based on his basic metabolic panel, the patient has a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia (>300 mg/dL), low bicarbonate levels (<15 mEq/L), acidosis (pH < 7.30), ketonemia, ketonuria, and dehydration. The absolute absence of insulin prevents cells from utilizing glucose. Fat becomes an alternative energy source, and in the process of fat breakdown, ketones are formed. The excess ketones cause an anion-gap metabolic acidosis, and patients with DKA compensate by hyperventilating. The severe dehydration and persistent acidemia have detrimental neurologic effects. Therefore it is common for patients with DKA to have changes in mental status, as well as nausea and vomiting. An infection often may precipitate DKA, so if a diabetic patient presents after a few days of pains or fevers, it is possible that besides the primary complaint, the patient subsequently may have developed DKA.",

The most common cause ischronic irritation by the eggs of the helminth Schistosoma haematobium, which lodge in the bladder wall.Although smoking has also been linked to an increased risk of SCC of the bladder, in this patient of African descent, helminth infection is the more likely risk factor. Squamous cell carcinoma can be distinguished from transitional cell carcinoma pathologically by its appearance. This specimen shows keratin pearl formation, a common ﬁnding in squamous cell cancers. In contrast to the United States, where transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder is the most common type of bladder cancer (it accounts for 95% of cases), countries in which Schistosoma haematobium is endemic have much higher rates of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.",

After primary stabilization (propranolol and attention to airway, breathing, and circulation), methimazole is the most appropriate pharmacologic treatment for this condition. Propylthiouracil is an alternative treatment that may be administered to patients who cannot tolerate methimazole or pregnant patients for whom methimazole is contraindicated due to its teratogenicity.

Iodine, which decreases the release of preformed thyroxine, can be used as an adjunct to propylthiouracil or methimazole but should not be used until one of these agents is allowed to take effect. In areas of the world where goiters are endemic, supplemental iodine is used to increase thyroid hormone production. Consequently, iodine administration could potentially worsen this patient's condition due to the escape phenomenon that can be seen with iodine administration.",

Another option is vacuum constriction devices, which are used to create an erection by drawing blood into the penis using vacuum pressure. This method has fewer side effects than medication, but it may not be as effective for some individuals. Finally, surgical procedures such as penile injections or implants can be considered as a long-term treatment option for severe cases of erectile dysfunction. However, these procedures come with risks and are not suitable for everyone. We can discuss these options in more detail and determine which might be the best course of action for you. Is there anything else you'd like to know before we wrap up?",

The patient is presenting after recent surgery with symptoms consistent with lactic acidosis. His low bicarbonate is concerning for an acidotic state. Calculating the anion gap [Na - (Cl + HCO3-) = anion gap] gives a result of 18. The physiologic range of the anion gap in healthy adults is 8-12 mEq/L. High-anion-gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by multiple conditions and can be remembered by the mnemonic MUDPILES: Methanol, Uremia, Diabetic ketoacidosis, Paraldehyde, Infection or isoniazid, Lactic acidosis, Ethylene glycol, and Salicylates. Metformin is a biguanide that suppresses hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity.

                "The correct answer is D. 71% chose this. This patient's history of a missed menstrual cycle suggests that she may be pregnant. However, ultrasound reveals an empty uterus. One of the most important concerns in a young woman of reproductive age who presents with acute, severe abdominal pain is ectopic pregnancy. The physical examination ﬁndings of abdominal pain with tenderness and rebound suggest peritoneal irritation, in this case most likely from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This process could also produce signiﬁcant bleeding into the peritoneal cavity, leading to hypotension. A pregnancy test, which detects the hormone β-human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG), either in the urine or in the plasma 8 days after successful fertilization, will be positive. β-hCG is a glycoprotein produced by the fertilized dividing egg during the ﬁrst trimester, and later by the placenta. This hormone's main function is to maintain the corpus luteum, the main source of progesterone, which is critical in maintaining the pregnancy. It also tends to be trended upward throughout initial days of pregnancy. βhCG has a distinctive α subunit, which it shares with other glycoprotein hormones, including thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. All of the glycoproteins with the exception of β-hCG are produced in the anterior pituitary gland.",
                "A is not correct. 10% chose this. ACTH is produced by the anterior pituitary gland from the precursor molecule proopiomelanocortin. It stimulates the production and secretion of adrenal cortical hormones. It does not share any structural homology to the glycoproteins.",
                "B is not correct. 5% chose this. ADH or vasopressin is a hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus but secreted from the posterior pituitary gland. Volume depletion and increased plasma osmolality stimulate its secretion. It promotes the insertion of aquaporin channels into the renal collecting ducts, thus augmenting free water reabsorption.",
                "C is not correct. 7% chose this. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) is another product of the precursor proopiomelanocortin. It is believed that this molecule is increased along with ACTH in patients with primary adrenal insufﬁciency, accounting for the darkening and discoloration of the skin commonly observed in those individuals. MSHdoes not share any structural homology with the glycoproteins.",
                "E is not correct. 7% chose this. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is produced in the hypothalamus. It stimulates the synthesis and release of TSH from the anterior pituitary gland. TRH also stimulates the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. TRH does not share any structural homology with the glycoproteins."

These arrhythmias are thought to be a result of the damaged, ischemic myocardium producing a substrate that is capable of abnormal reentry circuits. This results in the loss of coordinated contraction of the heart and perfusion of vital organs. VF is almost universally lethal if not treated; it very rarely reverts spontaneously to sinus rhythm. Immediate defibrillation is indicated, followed by medical treatment with intravenous amiodarone.",
                "B is not correct. 16% chose this. Cardiogenic shock carries a high risk of mortality and is associated with a large infarct. Any type of shock results in inadequate organ perfusion. Patients with cardiogenic shock present with hypotension and tachycardia.",
                "C is not correct. 5% chose this. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a later sequela of an MI that affects a large area of myocardial tissue. It results from functional myocardium being replaced with nonfunctional scar tissue, decreasing the heart's ability to contract, and leading to decreased ejection fraction. CHF would not present this soon after an MI.",
                "D is not correct. 3% chose this. Fibrinous pericarditis is associated with transmural infarctions and typically occurs 3-5 days post-MI. Some degree of diastolic dysfunction may occur due to inability of the ventricle to fully relax due to the transudate that collects in the pericardial sac. Physical examination typically reveals a friction rub. Dressler syndrome is an autoimmune condition that appears several weeks after an MI and also results in a fibrinous or serofibrinous pericarditis.",
                "E is not correct. 9% chose this. Left ventricular rupture is a complication that usually occurs 3-7 days post-MI, when the ventricular wall is in the dynamic process of resorbing necrotic tissue and building new tissue to fill the defect. If this were the case, the patient would present with the Beck triad (hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure, and distant heart sounds), secondary to hemopericardium. Risk factors for free wall rupture include female sex, age >60 years, and preexisting hypertension."

Hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis are symptoms of primary aldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), which is due to increased aldosterone secretion by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenals. As a consequence of the increased aldosterone activity in the principal cells of the collecting duct, an increase in sodium reuptake is accompanied by a concurrent increase in potassium excretion. Also, water is passively reabsorbed along with sodium, resulting in hypervolemia and higher blood pressures. SSS and GFR are useful for remembering the hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex and their location from the outside to the inside: aldosterone (Salt) from the zona Glomerulosa, cortisol (Sugar) from the zona Fasciculata, and androgens (Sex) from the zona Reticularis.",

The diagnosis is conﬁrmed by the presence of a Reed-Sternberg cell, which is diagnostic of Hodgkin lymphoma. These cells are large, with lobed nuclei that look like owl’s eyes, indicated by the circle in the image. Vinblastine is part of the ABVD regimen (Adriamycin [doxorubicin], Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine) used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma. It inhibits microtubular formation of the mitotic spindle, so affected cells cannot pass through metaphase. Vinblastine is used to treat both Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, as well as many solid tumors. Adverse effects include alopecia, constipation, myelosuppression, and, rarely, neurotoxicity.",
                "A is not correct. 15% chose this. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant used in patients who have undergone transplant and patients with autoimmune disorders. It works by inhibiting the production and release of interleukin-2, a cytokine involved in the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Adverse effects of cyclosporine include gastrointestinal upset, headache, and tremor. Myelosuppression, however, is not a common adverse effect.",
                "B is not correct. 10% chose this. Hydroxyurea is used to treat sickle cell anemia, and to decrease the burden of high WBC counts in acute leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Hydroxyurea is an anti-metabolite, and although its exact mechanism is unknown, it is believed to affect the synthesis (S) phase of the cell cycle. Its major adverse effect is myelosuppression.",
                "C is not correct. 16% chose this. Imatinib is used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and would not be helpful in a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients with CML present with increased neutrophils and metamyelocytes. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that speciﬁcally targets the continuously active Bcr-Abl receptor in CML, promoting apoptosis in these cells. Adverse effects include weight gain, gastrointestinal distress, musculoskeletal pain, and myelosuppression.",
                "D is not correct. 10% chose this. Isoniazid, along with rifampin, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, and ethambutol, is used to treat tuberculosis. Night sweats, fever, and weight loss are common in tuberculosis; however, the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells in this patient strongly suggests Hodgkin lymphoma. Isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis, thereby disrupting the Mycobacterium cell wall. Adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, neuropathy, and, in some cases, psychiatric symptoms."

This is because when the body is in a supine position, gravity no longer has as strong of an effect on blood flow, allowing blood to pool in the veins and leading to a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. The Carotid Sinus Baroreceptor and Vagal Efferent Activity to the Heart are both part of the body's reflexive mechanism for regulating blood pressure, so their activity would decrease in response to the decreased blood pressure. Meanwhile, the Atrial Stretch Receptor Activity would increase due to the increased volume of blood in the veins, leading to increased stretch in the atrial walls and stimulating the receptors. The answer is therefore (F) Carotid Sinus Baroreceptor Activity and Vagal Efferent Activity to the Heart decrease, while Atrial Stretch Receptor Activity increase.",

These are the cells that give rise to megakaryocytes, which are responsible for producing platelets. The high hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, as well as the increased platelet count and the presence of occasional giant platelets on the peripheral blood smear, suggest that the patient may have a condition known as essential thrombocythemia. This is a type of blood cancer in which the bone marrow produces too many platelets, leading to an increased risk of blood clots. The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase levels and the presence of splenomegaly on physical examination also support this diagnosis. Treatment for essential thrombocythemia typically involves medications to reduce the production of platelets and to prevent blood clots.

Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14 months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children. She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3 months ago. She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice. She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile, including 25 degrees of genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms, and flexibility at the waist, with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees.

During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally.

Instead, try sleeping on your side, which can help keep your airways open and reduce the risk of choking or gasping. You can also try using a high-fiber pillow, as these can help support your airways and prevent your head from drooping forward. Additionally, you might consider using a sleep apnea mask, which can provide a more precise and effective airway pressure support.

This could include activities like running or jumping, especially if you have any underlying medical conditions that make these activities potentially dangerous.

                "doctor": "Thank you for your questions. The medication I'm prescribing is a combination of prednisone and vinca alkaloids. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that helps to reduce inflammation and swelling, while vinca alkaloids are chemotherapy drugs that work by targeting cancer cells. The recommended dosage is to take 10 mg of prednisone twice daily, and to take 20 mg of vinca alkaloids once daily. The medications should be taken for at least 4 weeks to ensure that the symptoms are under control and the recovery process is effective. As for side effects, prednisone can cause weight gain, fluid retention, and mood changes, while vinca alkaloids can cause nausea, vomiting, and hair loss. It's important to report any side effects to me immediately if they occur. Additionally, it's important to follow a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet, to manage your condition effectively. Please take the medication as directed and follow up with me in a few weeks to discuss your progress.[医生]\n Thank you for the detailed information. I will definitely follow your instructions and take the medication as directed. I appreciate your help and guidance in managing my condition effectively.",
