Board review guides often emphasize that this species is a causative agent of fungal meningitis in immunocompromised patients (with Blastomyces, Coccidioides, and Histoplasma as causes of fungal pneumonia). Students should note, however, that these are oversimpliﬁcations. All the systemic mycoses can cause infection in a number of sites. Althoughmeningoencephalitis is the most common clinical manifestation of cryptococcal disease, it is not the only one. In fact, the initial site of inoculation with Cryptococcus is the lung; meningitis can ensue only after theyeasts have disseminated from this site. Patients present more often with cryptococcal meningitis, in large part because many lung infections are asymptomatic. When an individual does experience symptoms from cryptococcal pneumonia (the second most common clinical manifestation), the symptoms can include fever, fatigue, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. Other less common ﬁndings may include hemoptysis, auscultatory rales, or a pleural rub.",

Catecholamines in general promote potassium entry into cells by increasing the activities of the Na-K-ATPase pump, and the Na-K-2Cl (NKCC1) cotransporter. These ß-agonists have been proven in randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses to improve symptoms and lung function. They are typically prescribed on an as-needed basis rather than regularly scheduled, to decrease exposure in patients with less severe symptoms. Risks of ß-agonist overuse include tremor, tachycardia, and hypokalemia. As this patient is likely presenting with overdose of his albuterol inhaler, it is possible that he has developed hypokalemia, which can be very dangerous. The easiest way to measure serum potassium is through a basic metabolic panel, which quantiﬁes serum sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, creatinine, BUN, and glucose.",

Sulfonylureas act by increasing pancreatic production of insulin by β islet cells. Although vomiting can occur with alcohol toxicity, this patient is oriented and appropriate without ataxia, making this unlikely. Instead, this patient is presenting with signs of a disulfiram-like reaction after alcohol consumption, which include nausea, vomiting, headache, flushing, and tachycardia. First-generation sulfonylureas, and chlorpropamide in particular, can cause a disulfiram-like reaction when taken with ethanol. Other medications that are known to cause disulfiram-like reactions include metronidazole, procarbazine, and some cephalosporins.",

Acarbose is an α-glucosidase inhibitor that blocks the enzyme responsible for sugar hydrolysis at the intestinal lumen border, mitigating the spike in blood glucose after a meal. The adverse effects of α-glucosidase inhibitors are gastrointestinal disturbances causing abdominal pain and diarrhea.",
                "C is not correct. 7% chose this. Glargine is a long-acting synthetic insulin that provides a continuous baseline level of insulin in the blood. The most important adverse effect associated with this agent is hypoglycemia if this drug is taken in excess. Although hypoglycemia can lead to tachycardia, the physician also expects confusion or altered mental status and shakiness, which this patient does not have.",

The most important adverse effect associated with this agent is hypoglycemia. Second-generation sulfonylureas are much less likely to cause a disulfiram-like reaction than their first-generation kin. Because sulfonylureas are metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys, liver or renal insufficiency is a contraindication to their use.",

                "The correct answer is B. 82% chose this. People with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes are highly susceptible to developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Based on his basic metabolic panel, the patient has a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia (>300 mg/dL), low bicarbonate levels (<15 mEq/L), acidosis (pH < 7.30), ketonemia, ketonuria, and dehydration. The absolute absence of insulin prevents cells from utilizing glucose. Fat becomes an alternative energy source, and in the process of fat breakdown, ketones are formed. The excess ketones cause an anion-gap metabolic acidosis, and patients with DKA compensate by hyperventilating. The severe dehydration and persistent acidemia have detrimental neurologic effects. Therefore it is common for patients with DKA to have changes in mental status, as well as nausea and vomiting. An infection often may precipitate DKA, so if a diabetic patient presents after a few days of pains or fevers, it is possible that besides the primary complaint, the patient subsequently may have developed DKA.",

In DIC the formation of many microthrombi causes depletion of platelets, coagulation factors, and fibrin, resulting in widespread bleeding. DIC can be caused by obstetric complications, gram-negative sepsis, acute promyelocytic leukemia, and burns, but not by diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient has no signs suggestive of DIC.",
                "C is not correct. 6% chose this. Jaundice and liver failure are not associated with diabetic ketoacidosis; however, they will be seen in patients with acetaminophen toxicity. When taken in large doses, acetaminophen causes hepatic necrosis, resulting in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, and liver failure. Treatment is early administration of N-acetylcysteine. The patient has no history of acetaminophen intake.",

This patient is presenting with a medical emergency—an extreme form of thyrotoxicosis known as \"thyroid storm.\" The symptoms of this syndrome are due primarily to increased β-adrenergic outflow stimulated by excessive thyroid hormones. After primary stabilization (propranolol and attention to airway, breathing, and circulation), methimazole is the most appropriate pharmacologic treatment for this condition. Propylthiouracil is an alternative treatment that may be administered to patients who cannot tolerate methimazole or pregnant patients for whom methimazole is contraindicated due to its teratogenicity.  However, propylthiouracil is otherwise avoided due to concerns of hepatotoxicity.  Both agents inhibit the endogenous synthesis of thyroxine.",

Iodine, which decreases the release of preformed thyroxine, can be used as an adjunct to propylthiouracil or methimazole but should not be used until one of these agents is allowed to take effect. In areas of the world where goiters are endemic, supplemental iodine is used to increase thyroid hormone production. Consequently, iodine administration could potentially worsen this patient's condition due to the escape phenomenon that can be seen with iodine administration.",

This is a possible treatment for this patient, but antithyroid drugs are typically utilized before more invasive treatments, such as radioiodine ablation or surgical resection, are considered.",

                "The correct answer is C. 58% chose this. Given the patient's body habitus and glucose level, a diagnosis of diabetes is extremely likely. The patient is presenting after recent surgery with symptoms consistent with lactic acidosis. His low bicarbonate is concerning for an acidotic state. Calculating the anion gap [Na - (Cl + HCO3-) = anion gap] gives a result of 18. The physiologic range of the anion gap in healthy adults is 8-12 mEq/L. High-anion-gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by multiple conditions and can be remembered by the mnemonic MUDPILES: Methanol, Uremia, Diabetic ketoacidosis, Paraldehyde, Infection or isoniazid, Lactic acidosis, Ethylene glycol, and Salicylates. Metformin is a biguanide that suppresses hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity. It is known to increase the risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in those with renal impairment (the patient in this case has an elevated creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL), as well as in the postoperative period if it is stopped for an extended period.",
                "A is not correct. 13% chose this. Glyburide is a sulfonylurea that increases pancreatic secretion of insulin by depolarizing the β-cell membranes. Its major adverse effect is hypoglycemia, which could present as loss of consciousness, seizure, or altered mental status. However, the patient's lab values show that he is actually hyperglycemic, making glyburide less likely.",
                "B is not correct. 8% chose this. Insulin as a pharmacologic preparation is not administered orally, but rather is subcutaneously injected. It binds the insulin receptor to increase hepatic glycogen production from glucose and promote protein synthesis in muscle. A major adverse effect of insulin treatment is hypoglycemia, weight gain, and injection-site lipodystrophy, but it is not associated with lactic acidosis.",
                "D is not correct. 10% chose this. Orlistat alters fat metabolism by decreasing pancreatic lipase activity. It is often used for long-term weight management, and causes gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as loose and fatty stools (steatorrhea), diminished absorption of vitamins A, D, K, and E, and headache. It has not been associated with lactic acidosis.",
                "E is not correct. 11% chose this. Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that increases tissue sensitivity/target cell response to insulin. A major adverse effect of this medication is weight gain and edema, and it has also recently been associated with increased cardiovascular risks. However, it is not known to cause lactic acidosis."

                "The correct answer is D. 71% chose this. This patient's history of a missed menstrual cycle suggests that she may be pregnant. However, ultrasound reveals an empty uterus. One of the most important concerns in a young woman of reproductive age who presents with acute, severe abdominal pain is ectopic pregnancy. The physical examination ﬁndings of abdominal pain with tenderness and rebound suggest peritoneal irritation, in this case most likely from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This process could also produce signiﬁcant bleeding into the peritoneal cavity, leading to hypotension. A pregnancy test, which detects the hormone β-human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG), either in the urine or in the plasma 8 days after successful fertilization, will be positive. β-hCG is a glycoprotein produced by the fertilized dividing egg during the ﬁrst trimester, and later by the placenta. This hormone's main function is to maintain the corpus luteum, the main source of progesterone, which is critical in maintaining the pregnancy. It also tends to be trended upward throughout initial days of pregnancy. βhCG has a distinctive α subunit, which it shares with other glycoprotein hormones, including thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. All of the glycoproteins with the exception of β-hCG are produced in the anterior pituitary gland.",
                "A is not correct. 10% chose this. ACTH is produced by the anterior pituitary gland from the precursor molecule proopiomelanocortin. It stimulates the production and secretion of adrenal cortical hormones. It does not share any structural homology to the glycoproteins.",
                "B is not correct. 5% chose this. ADH or vasopressin is a hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus but secreted from the posterior pituitary gland. Volume depletion and increased plasma osmolality stimulate its secretion. It promotes the insertion of aquaporin channels into the renal collecting ducts, thus augmenting free water reabsorption.",
                "C is not correct. 7% chose this. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) is another product of the precursor proopiomelanocortin. It is believed that this molecule is increased along with ACTH in patients with primary adrenal insufﬁciency, accounting for the darkening and discoloration of the skin commonly observed in those individuals. MSHdoes not share any structural homology with the glycoproteins.",
                "E is not correct. 7% chose this. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is produced in the hypothalamus. It stimulates the synthesis and release of TSH from the anterior pituitary gland. TRH also stimulates the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. TRH does not share any structural homology with the glycoproteins."

                "The correct answer is A. 67% chose this. This individual is having a myocardial infarction (likely anterolateral given V3-V6 distribution), as suggested by his symptoms and ST-segment elevation on ECG. Sudden cardiac death in the setting of an MI is most commonly caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias, in particular ventricular fibrillation (VF). These arrhythmias are thought to be a result of the damaged, ischemic myocardium producing a substrate that is capable of abnormal reentry circuits. This results in the loss of coordinated contraction of the heart and perfusion of vital organs. VF is almost universally lethal if not treated; it very rarely reverts spontaneously to sinus rhythm. Immediate defibrillation is indicated, followed by medical treatment with intravenous amiodarone.",
                "B is not correct. 16% chose this. Cardiogenic shock carries a high risk of mortality and is associated with a large infarct. Any type of shock results in inadequate organ perfusion. Patients with cardiogenic shock present with hypotension and tachycardia.",
                "C is not correct. 5% chose this. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a later sequela of an MI that affects a large area of myocardial tissue. It results from functional myocardium being replaced with nonfunctional scar tissue, decreasing the heart's ability to contract, and leading to decreased ejection fraction. CHF would not present this soon after an MI.",
                "D is not correct. 3% chose this. Fibrinous pericarditis is associated with transmural infarctions and typically occurs 3-5 days post-MI. Some degree of diastolic dysfunction may occur due to inability of the ventricle to fully relax due to the transudate that collects in the pericardial sac. Physical examination typically reveals a friction rub. Dressler syndrome is an autoimmune condition that appears several weeks after an MI and also results in a fibrinous or serofibrinous pericarditis.",
                "E is not correct. 9% chose this. Left ventricular rupture is a complication that usually occurs 3-7 days post-MI, when the ventricular wall is in the dynamic process of resorbing necrotic tissue and building new tissue to fill the defect. If this were the case, the patient would present with the Beck triad (hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure, and distant heart sounds), secondary to hemopericardium.

Hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis are symptoms of primary aldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), which is due to increased aldosterone secretion by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenals. As a consequence of the increased aldosterone activity in the principal cells of the collecting duct, an increase in sodium reuptake is accompanied by a concurrent increase in potassium excretion. Also, water is passively reabsorbed along with sodium, resulting in hypervolemia and higher blood pressures. SSS and GFR are useful for remembering the hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex and their location from the outside to the inside: aldosterone (Salt) from the zona Glomerulosa, cortisol (Sugar) from the zona Fasciculata, and androgens (Sex) from the zona Reticularis.",

The diagnosis is conﬁrmed by the presence of a Reed-Sternberg cell, which is diagnostic of Hodgkin lymphoma. These cells are large, with lobed nuclei that look like owl’s eyes, indicated by the circle in the image. Vinblastine is part of the ABVD regimen (Adriamycin [doxorubicin], Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine) used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma. It inhibits microtubular formation of the mitotic spindle, so affected cells cannot pass through metaphase. Vinblastine is used to treat both Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, as well as many solid tumors. Adverse effects include alopecia, constipation, myelosuppression, and, rarely, neurotoxicity.",

Warfarin is an anticoagulant that inhibits the synthesis and γ-carboxylation of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. It is metabolized by the CYP450 system, primarily the CYP2C9 member. Note that the prothrombin time (PT), not the partial thromboplastin time, is used to follow warfarin levels. In this scenario, the INR is 1.05 which is subtherapeutic. This suggests inadequate anticoagulation possibly due to increased warfarin metabolism.",

In a pregnant woman who is receiving an intravenous opioid, this could potentially lead to neonatal respiratory depression in the baby.

This is because when the body is in a supine position, gravity no longer has as strong of an effect on blood flow, allowing blood to pool in the veins and leading to a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. The Carotid Sinus Baroreceptor and Vagal Efferent Activity to the Heart are both part of the body's reflexive mechanism for regulating blood pressure, so their activity would decrease in response to the decreased blood pressure. Meanwhile, the Atrial Stretch Receptor Activity would increase due to the increased volume of blood in the veins, leading to increased stretch in the atrial walls and stimulating the receptors. The answer is therefore (F) Carotid Sinus Baroreceptor Activity and Vagal Efferent Activity to the Heart decrease, while Atrial Stretch Receptor Activity increase.",

The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Results of the biopsy specimen disclose ductal carcinoma in situ. The physician informs the patient he has some bad news to share and tells her the diagnosis. He explains her treatment options, including mastectomy, breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and any combination of these options.

Options (A) and (D) do not provide enough information or guidance to the patient, while options (C) and (E) may not be appropriate at this stage as they assume that the patient has already made a decision about her treatment.

These are the cells that give rise to megakaryocytes, which are responsible for producing platelets. The high hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, as well as the increased platelet count and the presence of occasional giant platelets on the peripheral blood smear, suggest that the patient may have a condition known as essential thrombocythemia. This is a type of blood cancer in which the bone marrow produces too many platelets, leading to an increased risk of blood clots. The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase levels and the presence of splenomegaly on physical examination also support this diagnosis. Treatment for essential thrombocythemia typically involves medications to reduce the production of platelets and to prevent blood clots.

He has no symptoms or history of major medical illness. The patient’s maternal grandfather died of Huntington disease at the age of 35 years. Genetic testing of the mother showed 19 triplet repeats on each huntingtin (HTT) allele (N=10–20). The patient’s paternal grandfather had colon cancer at the age of 30 years, and the father had numerous colon polyps at the age of 20 years treated with a colectomy. Genetic testing of the father shows heterozygosity for a frame-shift mutation in the APC gene. Physical examination of the patient shows abnormalities.

As mentioned in the previous answers, the patient's family history puts them at an increased risk for Huntington disease, which is caused by a mutation in the HTT gene that results in an expanded number of CAG trinucleotide repeats. The severity of the disease is directly related to the number of repeats, and the patient's mother has 19 triplet repeats on each HTT allele, which puts the patient at an increased risk for Huntington disease. Genetic testing can determine the number of repeats in the patient's HTT gene and help guide appropriate medical management.

She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile, including 25 degrees of genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms, and flexibility at the waist, with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees.
