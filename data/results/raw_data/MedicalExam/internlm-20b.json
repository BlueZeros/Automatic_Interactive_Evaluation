                "The correct answer is A. 48% chose this. Salmeterol and albuterol act selectively at ß2-adrenergic receptors, causing bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. Catecholamines in general promote potassium entry into cells by increasing the activities of the Na-K-ATPase pump, and the Na-K-2Cl (NKCC1) cotransporter. These ß-agonists have been proven in randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses to improve symptoms and lung function. They are typically prescribed on an as-needed basis rather than regularly scheduled, to decrease exposure in patients with less severe symptoms. Risks of ß-agonist overuse include tremor, tachycardia, and hypokalemia. As this patient is likely presenting with overdose of his albuterol inhaler, it is possible that he has developed hypokalemia, which can be very dangerous. The easiest way to measure serum potassium is through a basic metabolic panel, which quantiﬁes serum sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, creatinine, BUN, and glucose.",

Nonetheless, this patient is not presenting with any symptoms of infection or pneumonia. Although chest X-rays are useful in monitoring the status of chronic lung conditions such as COPD, it is highly unlikely that this patient's COPD has changed signiﬁcantly since his ofﬁce visit 1 week ago.",

It is far more likely that he is overusing his newly prescribed ß-agonist.",
                "E is not correct. 13% chose this. Although intoxication with a variety of drugs can lead to tremors and tachycardia, it is much more likely that this patient's symptoms are due to his overuse of a ß-agonist, which was recently prescribed to reduce his COPD exacerbations."

It is often used after 2–3 years of tamoxifen treatment, or in patients who have hormone-responsive breast cancer that advances despite tamoxifen treatment.

                "The correct answer is B. 33% chose this. Chlorpropamide is a first-generation sulfonylurea used to treat type 2 diabetes. Sulfonylureas act by increasing pancreatic production of insulin by β islet cells. Although vomiting can occur with alcohol toxicity, this patient is oriented and appropriate without ataxia, making this unlikely. Instead, this patient is presenting with signs of a disulfiram-like reaction after alcohol consumption, which include nausea, vomiting, headache, flushing, and tachycardia. First-generation sulfonylureas, and chlorpropamide in particular, can cause a disulfiram-like reaction when taken with ethanol. Other medications that are known to cause disulfiram-like reactions include metronidazole, procarbazine, and some cephalosporins.",
                "A is not correct. 9% chose this. Acarbose is an α-glucosidase inhibitor that blocks the enzyme responsible for sugar hydrolysis at the intestinal lumen border, mitigating the spike in blood glucose after a meal. The adverse effects of α-glucosidase inhibitors are gastrointestinal disturbances causing abdominal pain and diarrhea.",
                "C is not correct. 7% chose this. Glargine is a long-acting synthetic insulin that provides a continuous baseline level of insulin in the blood. The most important adverse effect associated with this agent is hypoglycemia if this drug is taken in excess. Although hypoglycemia can lead to tachycardia, the physician also expects confusion or altered mental status and shakiness, which this patient does not have.",
                "D is not correct. 15% chose this. Glipizide is a second-generation sulfonylurea that acts by stimulating insulin production by pancreatic β islet cells. The most important adverse effect associated with this agent is hypoglycemia. Second-generation sulfonylureas are much less likely to cause a disulfiram-like reaction than their first-generation kin. Because sulfonylureas are metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys, liver or renal insufficiency is a contraindication to their use.",
                "E is not correct. 18% chose this. Metformin is an oral biguanide that is thought to inhibit gluconeogenesis and increase glycolysis, resulting in decreased blood glucose concentrations. The most serious adverse effect associated with this agent is lactic acidosis. It is also metabolized by the",

                "G is not correct. 7% chose this. Pramlintide is an amylin mimetic that decreases glucagon. Amylin is a peptide that is normally released by the β cells along with insulin. The adverse effects of pramlintide include hypoglycemia, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss."

Based on his basic metabolic panel, the patient has a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia (>300 mg/dL), low bicarbonate levels (<15 mEq/L), acidosis (pH < 7.30), ketonemia, ketonuria, and dehydration. The absolute absence of insulin prevents cells from utilizing glucose. Fat becomes an alternative energy source, and in the process of fat breakdown, ketones are formed. The excess ketones cause an anion-gap metabolic acidosis, and patients with DKA compensate by hyperventilating. The severe dehydration and persistent acidemia have detrimental neurologic effects. Therefore it is common for patients with DKA to have changes in mental status, as well as nausea and vomiting. An infection often may precipitate DKA, so if a diabetic patient presents after a few days of pains or fevers, it is possible that besides the primary complaint, the patient subsequently may have developed DKA.",

Although this condition is rare in the United States, it is the most common type of bladder cancer in the world. The most common cause ischronic irritation by the eggs of the helminth Schistosoma haematobium, which lodge in the bladder wall.Although smoking has also been linked to an increased risk of SCC of the bladder, in this patient of African descent, helminth infection is the more likely risk factor. Squamous cell carcinoma can be distinguished from transitional cell carcinoma pathologically by its appearance. This specimen shows keratin pearl formation, a common ﬁnding in squamous cell cancers. In contrast to the United States, where transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder is the most common type of bladder cancer (it accounts for 95% of cases), countries in which Schistosoma haematobium is endemic have much higher rates of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.",

This patient is presenting with a medical emergency—an extreme form of thyrotoxicosis known as \"thyroid storm.\" The symptoms of this syndrome are due primarily to increased β-adrenergic outflow stimulated by excessive thyroid hormones. After primary stabilization (propranolol and attention to airway, breathing, and circulation), methimazole is the most appropriate pharmacologic treatment for this condition. Propylthiouracil is an alternative treatment that may be administered to patients who cannot tolerate methimazole or pregnant patients for whom methimazole is contraindicated due to its teratogenicity.

The patient is presenting after recent surgery with symptoms consistent with lactic acidosis. His low bicarbonate is concerning for an acidotic state. Calculating the anion gap [Na - (Cl + HCO3-) = anion gap] gives a result of 18. The physiologic range of the anion gap in healthy adults is 8-12 mEq/L. High-anion-gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by multiple conditions and can be remembered by the mnemonic MUDPILES: Methanol, Uremia, Diabetic ketoacidosis, Paraldehyde, Infection or isoniazid, Lactic acidosis, Ethylene glycol, and Salicylates. Metformin is a biguanide that suppresses hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity. It is known to increase the risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in those with renal impairment (the patient in this case has an elevated creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL), as well as in the postoperative period if it is stopped for an extended period.",

Its major adverse effect is hypoglycemia, which could present as loss of consciousness, seizure, or altered mental status. However, the patient's lab values show that he is actually hyperglycemic, making glyburide less likely.",
                "B is not correct. 8% chose this. Insulin as a pharmacologic preparation is not administered orally, but rather is subcutaneously injected. It binds the insulin receptor to increase hepatic glycogen production from glucose and promote protein synthesis in muscle. A major adverse effect of insulin treatment is hypoglycemia, weight gain, and injection-site lipodystrophy, but it is not associated with lactic acidosis.",
                "D is not correct. 10% chose this. Orlistat alters fat metabolism by decreasing pancreatic lipase activity. It is often used for long-term weight management, and causes gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as loose and fatty stools (steatorrhea), diminished absorption of vitamins A, D, K, and E, and headache. It has not been associated with lactic acidosis.",

                "The correct answer is D. 71% chose this. This patient's history of a missed menstrual cycle suggests that she may be pregnant. However, ultrasound reveals an empty uterus. One of the most important concerns in a young woman of reproductive age who presents with acute, severe abdominal pain is ectopic pregnancy. The physical examination ﬁndings of abdominal pain with tenderness and rebound suggest peritoneal irritation, in this case most likely from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This process could also produce signiﬁcant bleeding into the peritoneal cavity, leading to hypotension. A pregnancy test, which detects the hormone β-human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG), either in the urine or in the plasma 8 days after successful fertilization, will be positive. β-hCG is a glycoprotein produced by the fertilized dividing egg during the ﬁrst trimester, and later by the placenta. This hormone's main function is to maintain the corpus luteum, the main source of progesterone, which is critical in maintaining the pregnancy. It also tends to be trended upward throughout initial days of pregnancy. βhCG has a distinctive α subunit, which it shares with other glycoprotein hormones, including thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. All of the glycoproteins with the exception of β-hCG are produced in the anterior pituitary gland.",
                "A is not correct. 10% chose this. ACTH is produced by the anterior pituitary gland from the precursor molecule proopiomelanocortin. It stimulates the production and secretion of adrenal cortical hormones. It does not share any structural homology to the glycoproteins.",
                "B is not correct. 5% chose this. ADH or vasopressin is a hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus but secreted from the posterior pituitary gland. Volume depletion and increased plasma osmolality stimulate its secretion. It promotes the insertion of aquaporin channels into the renal collecting ducts, thus augmenting free water reabsorption.",
                "C is not correct. 7% chose this. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) is another product of the precursor proopiomelanocortin. It is believed that this molecule is increased along with ACTH in patients with primary adrenal insufﬁciency, accounting for the darkening and discoloration of the skin commonly observed in those individuals. MSHdoes not share any structural homology with the glycoproteins.",
                "E is not correct. 7% chose this. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is produced in the hypothalamus. It stimulates the synthesis and release of TSH from the anterior pituitary gland. TRH also stimulates the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. TRH does not share any structural homology with the glycoproteins."

                "The correct answer is A. 67% chose this. This individual is having a myocardial infarction (likely anterolateral given V3-V6 distribution), as suggested by his symptoms and ST-segment elevation on ECG. Sudden cardiac death in the setting of an MI is most commonly caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias, in particular ventricular fibrillation (VF). These arrhythmias are thought to be a result of the damaged, ischemic myocardium producing a substrate that is capable of abnormal reentry circuits. This results in the loss of coordinated contraction of the heart and perfusion of vital organs. VF is almost universally lethal if not treated; it very rarely reverts spontaneously to sinus rhythm. Immediate defibrillation is indicated, followed by medical treatment with intravenous amiodarone.",
                "B is not correct. 16% chose this. Cardiogenic shock carries a high risk of mortality and is associated with a large infarct. Any type of shock results in inadequate organ perfusion. Patients with cardiogenic shock present with hypotension and tachycardia.",
                "C is not correct. 5% chose this. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a later sequela of an MI that affects a large area of myocardial tissue. It results from functional myocardium being replaced with nonfunctional scar tissue, decreasing the heart's ability to contract, and leading to decreased ejection fraction. CHF would not present this soon after an MI.",
                "D is not correct. 3% chose this. Fibrinous pericarditis is associated with transmural infarctions and typically occurs 3-5 days post-MI. Some degree of diastolic dysfunction may occur due to inability of the ventricle to fully relax due to the transudate that collects in the pericardial sac. Physical examination typically reveals a friction rub. Dressler syndrome is an autoimmune condition that appears several weeks after an MI and also results in a fibrinous or serofibrinous pericarditis.",
                "E is not correct. 9% chose this. Left ventricular rupture is a complication that usually occurs 3-7 days post-MI, when the ventricular wall is in the dynamic process of resorbing necrotic tissue and building new tissue to fill the defect. If this were the case, the patient would present with the Beck triad (hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure, and distant heart sounds), secondary to hemopericardium.

Hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis are symptoms of primary aldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), which is due to increased aldosterone secretion by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenals. As a consequence of the increased aldosterone activity in the principal cells of the collecting duct, an increase in sodium reuptake is accompanied by a concurrent increase in potassium excretion. Also, water is passively reabsorbed along with sodium, resulting in hypervolemia and higher blood pressures. SSS and GFR are useful for remembering the hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex and their location from the outside to the inside: aldosterone (Salt) from the zona Glomerulosa, cortisol (Sugar) from the zona Fasciculata, and androgens (Sex) from the zona Reticularis.",

The diagnosis is conﬁrmed by the presence of a Reed-Sternberg cell, which is diagnostic of Hodgkin lymphoma. These cells are large, with lobed nuclei that look like owl’s eyes, indicated by the circle in the image. Vinblastine is part of the ABVD regimen (Adriamycin [doxorubicin], Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine) used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma. It inhibits microtubular formation of the mitotic spindle, so affected cells cannot pass through metaphase. Vinblastine is used to treat both Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, as well as many solid tumors. Adverse effects include alopecia, constipation, myelosuppression, and, rarely, neurotoxicity.",

Imatinib is used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and would not be helpful in a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients with CML present with increased neutrophils and metamyelocytes. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that speciﬁcally targets the continuously active Bcr-Abl receptor in CML, promoting apoptosis in these cells.

Warfarin is an anticoagulant that inhibits the synthesis and γ-carboxylation of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. It is metabolized by the CYP450 system, primarily the CYP2C9 member. Note that the prothrombin time (PT), not the partial thromboplastin time, is used to follow warfarin levels. In this scenario, the INR is 1.05 which is subtherapeutic. This suggests inadequate anticoagulation possibly due to increased warfarin metabolism.",

Opioids are a class of medications that are commonly used to manage pain, and they work by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and other tissues. However, opioids can also have adverse effects, including respiratory depression, which is a condition in which the body's ability to breathe is impaired. In a pregnant woman who is receiving an intravenous opioid, this could potentially lead to neonatal respiratory depression in the baby. This is particularly concerning in the context of labor and delivery, when the baby is already at risk of respiratory distress due to the physical stresses of being born.

This is because when the body is in a supine position, gravity no longer has as strong of an effect on blood flow, allowing blood to pool in the veins and leading to a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. The Carotid Sinus Baroreceptor and Vagal Efferent Activity to the Heart are both part of the body's reflexive mechanism for regulating blood pressure, so their activity would decrease in response to the decreased blood pressure. Meanwhile, the Atrial Stretch Receptor Activity would increase due to the increased volume of blood in the veins, leading to increased stretch in the atrial walls and stimulating the receptors.

These are the cells that give rise to megakaryocytes, which are responsible for producing platelets. The high hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, as well as the increased platelet count and the presence of occasional giant platelets on the peripheral blood smear, suggest that the patient may have a condition known as essential thrombocythemia. This is a type of blood cancer in which the bone marrow produces too many platelets, leading to an increased risk of blood clots. The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase levels and the presence of splenomegaly on physical examination also support this diagnosis.

Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14 months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children. She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3 months ago. She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice. She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile, including 25 degrees of genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms, and flexibility at the waist, with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees.

She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, \"I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months.\" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers.

One episode of chlamydial cervicitis was detected during the last trimester and treated with azithromycin. The neonate was born via cesarean delivery due to fetal heart rate decelerations.
